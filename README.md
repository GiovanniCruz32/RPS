This is a rock, paper, scissors game made in python.
When you run the program, the user will be prompted to input either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
Which ever option you choose must be typed exactly as shown above.
I added an option to exit the game from within the input prompt. Simply type "Quit".
