This is a rock, paper, scissors game made in python.
When you run the program, the user will be prompted to input either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
Which ever option you choose must be typed exactly as shown above.
The Computer will have already chosen a random option before you chose yours, however, the computer does not know what you chose and cannot change its own choice.
The program decides who wins ssing nested if/elif/else statements to check every possible outcome of the game and return a message stating the winner, a tie, or an error.
I added an option to exit the game from within the input prompt. Simply type "Quit".
